operators are special symbols used in c-programming to perform operations on variables and values
Types of operators
1.Arthimatic operators
it is used for mathematical calculations
>+ Addition->a+b
>- Subtraction->a-b
>* Multiplication->a*b
>/ Division->a/b
% Modulus(remainder)->a%b
2.Assignment Operators
The assignment operators is = it is used to store rightside value of the left side variables
a=6;its means that the value 6 stores in 'a'
>Compound assignment operators: there are five compound assignment opperators in 'c' program they are
+=,-=,*=,\=,%=
3.Logical operators 
used to combine conditions
1.&&-logical AND
2.||-logical OR
3.!-logical NOT
4.Relational operators
used to compare two values
== Equal to
!=Not equal to
> grater than 
< less than
>=greater than or equal to
<=less than or equal to
[if true means the value is 1]
[if false means the value is 0]
5.Increment and decrement operators
used to incraese or decrease value by 1
>> ++ Increment 
>> --Decrement
they are types of
Pre-increment ++a
Post-increment a++
Pre-Decrement a--
Post-Decrement --a
6.Bitwise opperators
opperator on binary values
&AND
|OR
^XOR
-NOT
<<left shift
>>Right shift
7.Conditional operator
if-else statement
8.Special operators
sizeof C-gives size of data type
typeof javascript-gives data type
,comma opperator
these are the operators
